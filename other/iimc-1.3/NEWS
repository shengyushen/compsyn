IImc 1.1

The major addition to IImc 1.1 is the new CTL model checking engine
from the CAV’12 paper: ”Incremental Inductive CTL Model Checking” by
Z. Hassan, A. R. Bradley, and F. Somenzi.

Additions in Release 1.1:

 - A new engine, IICTL, which is a new “IC3-like” model checking
   engine for CTL properties with fairness constraints
 - A new BMC engine for fair-cycle detection
 - Slightly improved performance for some of the model checking engines
 - A few bug fixes

IImc 1.1 has been compiled with g++ 4.4.6, 4.5.3, 4.6.3, 4.7.2, and
clang++ 3.0, and has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10, Red Hat
Enterprise 6.3, and Cygwin 1.7.
