CADDIE : The CAml cuDD InterfacE 
------ 
Our CAML chews the CUDD

********************************************

Installation Notes:
------------------
Before compiling CADDIE, you need to compile:
1) CUDD. We've tested CADDIE with CUDD version 2.3.0
2) OCAML. The version we've used is 3.00

Quick Install Guide
1. Modify BDDDIR in Makefile to point to the directory where
   you have installed CUDD
2. Modify CAMLINC in Makefile to point to the directory where
   you have installed OCAML
3. make

Options for make

1. make all: creates 'caddie', a top level CAML shell with the
             CUDD support built in, and 'runCaddie.cma'
             
2. make caddie : creates only the toplevel system 'caddie'
3. make runtime : creates only 'runCaddie.cma'
