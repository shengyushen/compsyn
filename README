1 Introduction

This package provide a set of program to synthesis decoder automatically
from encoder.  The set of program is in vp/ and other/ directories.

All related paper can be found in
https://github.com/shengyushen/dualsyn_paper

2 Pre-requirement

To use these program, some other linux programs are need:

1 synopsy design compiler: it is used to compile complex verilog source
code into relative simpler form, such that our verilog parser can process
it. If you dont have design compiler, then we also provide intermediate
file dc_synres.v generated by design compiler, such that you can try
our programes.	2 gnu develope environment : it include gcc and glibc and
so on. it is used to compile our program.  3 Ocaml develop environement:
it is used to compile our program.

3 Usage:

3.1 adding new path setting into PATH environment
 source ~/compsyn/scr/setup.scr


3.2 building our programs
  d ~/compsyn/ source scr/makeall.scr

3.3 to try our testbenchs, please go into every sub-dir of ~/compsyn/test/
and there will be a run dir, cd into it, and some options avialable to you

    ICCAD'09 and TCAD'10: Incomplete appraoch to check existence of
    decoder + ALLSAT
        make naive

    TCAD'11 : Halting approach based on loop like detection + interpolant
    based characterization
        make halting

    ICCAD'11 : Inferring assertion, this option has been further developed
    to include multiple decoder discovering in following TCAD12 option
    TCAD'12 : Inferring assertion, and discovering multiple decoder.There
    are 5 directories in ~/compsyn/test/:
        pcie_noass 
	  		scrambler_noass 
		  	t2ether_noass 
			  xfi_noass xgxs_noass

      NOTICE : PCIE, XGXS and XFI contains some private code that can't
      be shared, so only dc_synres.v is provided to replace source code.
      Please DONT run "make distclean", which will clean this intermediate
      file.

      Each of these directories contains a benchmark without assertions.
      For example, to infer assertion and generate decoders for
      pcie_noass, just run following commands :
	      cd pcie_noass/run 
				make infer_multidec_not_charfirst_nowall_cnt

      If these commands produce only a resulting_dual_cnf_0.v file, then
      only 1 decoder exists.  if they produce resulting_dual_cnf_0.v
      and resulting_dual_cnf_1.v, then each of them contains a decoder.

      to test resulting_dual_cnf_0.v with simulator, just run :
      	source ../scr/sim.scr 0
      similarly, to test resulting_dual_cnf_1.v with simulator, just run :
      	source ../scr/sim.scr 1

      Simulation result will show the value of signal "correct", if
      it is always 1, then the generated decoder match exactly the
      functionality of its encoder.

    TODAES'14 : handling flow control mechanism
      there are three dir in ~/compsyn/test/ pcie_relational
      t2ether_relational xgxs_relational

      These are encoders with flow control mechanism, to run these
      benchmark
      	make relational
      it will generate the decoder with flow control mechanism

    TODAES'14 revision 1 : handling flow control mechanism faster with
    incremental SAT
      make relational_plr_inc

    newer version : converting minisat interface to support multiple
    sat solver at the same time, also dont need deisgn compiler after
    generating decoder's verilog code that can directly read by ABC
      make multisat
