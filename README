1 Introduction

This package provide a set of program to synthesis decoder automatically from
encoder.
The set of program is in vp/ and other/ directories.

2 Pre-requirement

To use these program, a x86/64 machine with at at least 8GB memory and a Ubuntu 1004 OS is need.

To use these program, some other linux programs are need:

1	synopsy design compiler: it is used to compile complex verilog
	source code into relative simpler form, such that our verilog parser can
	process it. If you dont have design compiler, then we also provide
	intermediate file dc_synres.v generated by design compiler, such that you can try
	our programes.
2	gnu develope environment : it include gcc and glibc and so on. it is
	used to compile our program.
3	Ocaml develop environement: it is used to compile our program.

3 Usage:

3.1	modifying the Ocaml-C interface files. This step is only needed before ocaml 4.0.0
	cd ~
	tar -zxvf compsyn_xx.tgz
change to root user, and : 
	cp ~/compsyn/aux/*.h  ~/usr/local/lib/ocaml/caml/
	
3.3	adding new path setting into PATH environment 
	source ~/compsyn/scr/setup.scr


3.4	building our programs
	cd ~/compsyn/
	source scr/makeall.scr

3.5	to try our testbenchs, please go into every sub-dir of ~/compsyn/test/
	and there will be a run dir, cd into it, and some options avialable to you
	
		ICCAD'09 and TCAD'10: incomplete appraoch to check existence of decoder + ALLSAT
			make naive
		TCAD'11 : halting approach based on loop like detection + interpolant based characterization
			make halting
		ICCAD'11 : inferring assertion, this option has been further developed to include multiple decoder discovering in following TCAD12 option
		TCAD'12 : inferring assertion, and discovering multiple decoder 
			there are 5 directories in ~/compsyn/test/:
			pcie_noass
			scrambler_noass
			t2ether_noass
			xfi_noass
			xgxs_noass
			
			NOTICE : PCIE, XGXS and XFI contains some private code that can't be exposed,
			so only dc_synres.v is provided to replace source code.
			Please DONT run "make distclean", which will clean this intermediate file.

			each of these directories contains a benchmark without assertions. 
			For example, 
			to infer assertion and generate decoders for pcie_noass, just run following commands :
			cd pcie_noass/run
			make infer_multidec_not_charfirst_nowall_cnt
			
			if these commands produce only a resulting_dual_cnf_0.v file, then only 1 decoder exists.
			if they produce resulting_dual_cnf_0.v and resulting_dual_cnf_1.v, 
			then each of them contains a decoder.

			to test resulting_dual_cnf_0.v with simulator, just run :
			source ../scr/sim.scr 0
			similarly, to test resulting_dual_cnf_1.v with simulator, just run :
			source ../scr/sim.scr 1
			
			simulation result will show the value of signal "correct",
			if it is always 1, then the generated decoder match exactly the functionality of its encoder.
			
		TODAES'14 : handling flow control mechanism
			there are three dir in ~/compsyn/test/
			pcie_relational
			t2ether_relational
			xgxs_relational

			these are encoders with flow control mechanism, to run these benchmark
				make relational
			it will generate the decoder with flow control mechanism

		TODAES'14 revision 1 : handling flow control mechanism faster with incremental SAT
			make relational_plr_inc

		newer version : converting minisat interface to support multiple sat solver at the same time,
		                also dont need deisgn compiler after generating decoder's verilog code that can directly 
										read by ABC
			make multisat
