1	try ic3
2	recovering as much as possible
OK	3	supporting multiple sat solver at the same time
4	removing redundency in reducing l to neg number
5	faster interpolant pack
OK	6	interpolant pack can use two sat solver to run, one for detecting un coverred solution, must rule out exact formula, the other for enlarging, no rule out need
7	use abc to replace dc as much as possible, dc should only used in rtl source code
OK	8	meger AB and AB_mass
9	allsat_interp_BDD_loop use incremental SAT to replace individual characterization_interp
OK	10	in AB_mass use incremental SAT
