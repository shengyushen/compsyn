compsyn	check 
	the complementary condition, ICCAD'09 and TCAD'10
compsyn_halting	
	the halting that proposed in TCAD'11, 
	1	it checks all combinations of d p and l, so it is very slow. 
	2	but it use Craig interpolant to characterize the decoder's function
compsyn_halting_fast	
	the faster version of compsyn_halting, 
	1	it checks d p and l with the same value, so it is faster, 
	2	but it use the zchaff and XORMIN to characterize the decoder function, which is slower but with better area and timing

compsyn_infer_multidec
	generating multiple decoders if they actually exist, 
	the inferring algorithm is presented in ICCAD'11
	and the fd_test is based on functional dependency
compsyn_infer_multidec_not
	generating multiple decoders with following miprovements:
	1	use more general approach to force inferred assertions
	2	write gen_IA_I to replace gen_IA, which are the same except some comments
	3	write fd_test_I to replace fd_test, the former use the pair-wise not euqal to replace the functional test in the latter.
	4	write gen_IA_O and fd_test_O to work from input to output, 
		unlike gen_IA_I and fd_test_I that work from output to input.
		but these code fail in test, so we dont use them
compsyn_infer_multidec_not_charfirst
	generating multiple decoders with following miprovements:
	1	characterize the total inverse function first, then use it together with orignal relation, 
		the formmer will be used in fd_test, while the latter will be used to constraint the domain of bv_O
compsyn_infer_multidec_not_charfirst_nowall
	fixing following bug in infer_multidec_not_charfirst:
	1	false in inferred pre condition

compsyn_relarional : 
	handling flow control mechanism, submitted to TODAES14

compsyn_relarional_plr :
	minimizing p, l and r 

compsyn_relarional_plr_fast :

compsyn_relarional_plr_inc : 
	speedup characterizing decoder function with incremental SAT

compsyn_relarional_plr_inc_nominlr	:
	not minimize l and r based on compsyn_relarional_plr_inc, just for comparison

compsyn_relarional_plr_inc_plr1by1 :
	incremental p l and r one by one, just for comparing to compsyn_relarional_plr_inc



lsi10k2rtl	for some confidential RTL code, we dont want to expose them to public.
		So we first map these RTL to LSI10K netlist with design compiler,
		and then use lsi10k2rtl to convert LSI10K netlist to psudo RTL, 
		In this way, we can replace confidential RTL code with psudo RTL.
